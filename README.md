# flutter_embed_unity_android

The Android implementation of [`flutter_embed_unity`][1].

## Usage

### Import the package

This package has been endorsed, meaning that you only need to add `flutter_embed_unity`
as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`. It will be automatically included in your app
when you depend on `package:flutter_embed_unity`.

This is what the above means to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  flutter_embed_unity: ^0.0.1
  ...
```

If you wish to use the Android package only, you can add `flutter_embed_unity_android` as a
dependency:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  flutter_embed_unity_2022_3_android: ^0.0.1
  ...
```
